# Machine Learning Projects

## Supervised learning 
It is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using labeled data. The goal is to learn a function that can predict the output given a new input. Common supervised learning tasks include classification and regression.

## Unsupervised learning
It is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained using unlabeled data. The goal is to find patterns or structure in the data. Common unsupervised learning tasks include clustering and dimensionality reduction.

## Instance-based learning 
It is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns by storing instances or examples and then generalizing to new instances based on a similarity measure. This is typically used for classification and regression problems.

## FFNN (Feedforward Neural Network)
It is a type of neural network where the information flows in one direction from input to output. It is commonly used for tasks such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing.

## RBFNN (Radial Basis Function Neural Network)
It is a type of neural network that uses radial basis functions as activation functions. It is commonly used for tasks such as function approximation and time series prediction.

## Self-organizing map (SOM) 
It is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that is used to project high-dimensional data onto a low-dimensional space while preserving the topological structure of the data. SOMs are used for visualization and dimensionality reduction.
